# jwks_server
Project 1 for CSCE3550. 

How to run:

Setup Virtual Environment:
python3 -m venv venv (or python)
Activate it:
source venv/bin/activate
Then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the flask app:
python app.py

This will start the app up. 
It should say something like: 
"
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080
 * Running on http://192.168.1.57:8080
Press CTRL+C to quit
"
This means the app is up and running.

How to test it?
Install this: https://github.com/jh125486/CSCE3550
Unzip it
Drag the files into a folder in your working directory
Open up a second terminal
Navigate to the correct directory (should be a directory inside of the working one. So a directory on the same level as app.py)
Run: go run main.go project1
